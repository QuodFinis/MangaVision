## Project Description

Introducing MangaVision, a impactful project with a lot of potentials, designed with manga enthusiasts. Our passion for reading manga drives us to create a solution that enhances accessibility and enjoyment for all especially individuals with visual impairments in mind.

MangaVision aims to provide a comprehensive experience by describing visual events within manga pages to the reader. Through innovative technology, we enable users to have image speech bubbles read aloud and offer the convenience of summarizing the overall plot of chapters/volumes, enhancing understanding and engagement.

Potential Key features of MangaVision include leveraging OCR technology to seamlessly scan and edit texts within image speech bubbles. This capability opens up new possibilities for accessibility and customization. Furthermore, our platform facilitates the translation of native manga texts from Japanese to English, broadening the reach and appeal of manga content.

With MangaVision, we strive to break barriers and foster inclusivity within the manga community and expanding outward.

## Resources Exploration

### Documentations
[Object Detection for Comics using Manga109 Annotations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08670.pdf) - The article discusses the challenges and solutions in object detection for comics, focusing on the creation of the Manga109-annotations dataset and the proposed SSD300-fork detection method. Manga109-annotations was meticulously created over eight months by manually annotating the Manga109 dataset, resulting in a comprehensive dataset containing bounding boxes, character names, and text contents. To address the assignment problem in object detection, SSD300-fork was introduced, which replicates the detection layer for each category to mitigate assignment issues. Evaluation of SSD300-fork demonstrated superior performance compared to other CNN-based methods, achieving a 3% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) and a notable 9% increase in face detection accuracy over SSD300. Furthermore, application of SSD300-fork to the eBDtheque dataset yielded promising results, showcasing significant advancements in body detection compared to existing methods. Overall, the paper provides valuable contributions to the field of object detection for comics through the creation of a large-scale annotated dataset and the proposal of an effective detection method to tackle the unique challenges posed by comics.
