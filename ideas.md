|------|--------|
| [Optical character recognition for Japanese text for Manga](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr) | <li> Outlined the development of an OCR model designed for manga text recognition, utilizing an approach built on the Transformers' Vision Encoder Decoder framework. </li> <li> OCR model support vertical/horizontal text, furigana annotations, text overlaid on images, various fonts and styles, low-quality images and enables multi-line text recognition by processing entire text bubbles without line splitting. </li> |
| [Text detection](https://github.com/dmMaze/comic-text-detector) | <li> Contained training scripts for a text detector designed for manga which can identify bounding-boxes, text lines, and text segmentation to aid in various translation tasks such as text removal, recognition, and lettering. </li> <li> Current model was trained on approximately 13 thousand anime and comic-style images, utilizing data from Manga109-s, DCM, and synthetic data generated. </li> |
| [Text-To-Speech](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS) | <li> Provides Text-to-Speech (TTS) library which focused on advanced TTS generation, balancing ease of training, speed, and quality. </li> <li> TTS offers pretrained models, tools for dataset quality measurement, and supports over 20 languages for products and research projects </li> <li> Features high-performance Deep Learning models for Text2Speech tasks. </li> |
| [Mokuro - Perform text detection and OCR for each page and generate HTML file](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro) | <li> Outlined Mokuro, a tool for Japanese learners aiming to read manga in Japanese with the aid of a pop-up dictionary akin to Yomichan. </li> <li> Mokuro conducts text detection and optical character recognition for each page of the manga. </li> <li> Mokuro generates an HTML file that users can open in a browser. </li> |
| [Downloading manga pages as images](https://github.com/manga-download/hakuneko) | <li> Introduced HakuNeko, a cross-platform downloader designed for manga/anime enthusiasts to obtain content from various websites. </li> <li> Assist users in downloading media for situations where offline access is needed. </li> <li> HakuNeko focused on users download content only when they intend to read it, rather than mass downloading thousands of chapters that may never be consumed. </li> |

| [Text Extraction and Detection from Images using Machine Learning Techniques: A Research Review](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9752274) | To help human beings with a different language from different parts of the world so that they can easily read and understand any language written, and to recognize handwritten text and text captured from images to convert them into digital format. | 2021 | Text extraction, Text detection, Machine Learning Algorithms, Pre-Processing, Segmentation, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) |
| [Object Recognition in Hand Drawn Images Using Machine Ensembling Techniques and Smote Sampling](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-1384-8_19) | Techniques to classify the stroke-based hand-drawn object. Uses the Quick Draw dataset which is a repository of approximately 50 million hand-drawn drawings of 345 different objects. An approach to the classification of these drawings created using hand strokes. | 2019 | SMOTE, Machine learning, ClassiÔ¨Åcation, Hyper-parameterselection, Ensembling |
| [Automatic classification of manga characters using density-based clustering](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11515/115150F/Automatic-classification-of-manga-characters-using-density-based-clustering/10.1117/12.2566845.short#_=_) | To classify characters is to get image features from the character's faces and cluster them. To allocate metadata more efficiently, technology that automatically extracts elements such as character and speech is required. | 2020 | Dimension reduction, Communication engineering, Algorithm development, Computer engineering, Detection and tracking algorithms, Facial recognition systems, Feature extraction, Image classification, Computer science, Data conversion |
