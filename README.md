## Project Description

Introducing MangaVision, a impactful project with a lot of potentials, designed with manga enthusiasts. Our passion for reading manga drives us to create a solution that enhances accessibility and enjoyment for all especially individuals with visual impairments in mind.

MangaVision aims to provide a comprehensive experience by describing visual events within manga pages to the reader. Through innovative technology, we enable users to have image speech bubbles read aloud and offer the convenience of summarizing the overall plot of chapters/volumes, enhancing understanding and engagement.

Potential Key features of MangaVision include leveraging OCR technology to seamlessly scan and edit texts within image speech bubbles. This capability opens up new possibilities for accessibility and customization. Furthermore, our platform facilitates the translation of native manga texts from Japanese to English, broadening the reach and appeal of manga content.

With MangaVision, we strive to break barriers and foster inclusivity within the manga community and expanding outward.
