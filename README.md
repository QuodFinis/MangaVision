## Project Description

Introducing MangaVision, a impactful project with a lot of potentials, designed with manga enthusiasts. Our passion for reading manga drives us to create a solution that enhances accessibility and enjoyment for all especially individuals with visual impairments in mind.

MangaVision aims to provide a comprehensive experience by describing visual events within manga pages to the reader. Through innovative technology, we enable users to have image speech bubbles read aloud and offer the convenience of summarizing the overall plot of chapters/volumes, enhancing understanding and engagement.

Potential Key features of MangaVision include leveraging OCR technology to seamlessly scan and edit texts within image speech bubbles. This capability opens up new possibilities for accessibility and customization. Furthermore, our platform facilitates the translation of native manga texts from Japanese to English, broadening the reach and appeal of manga content.

With MangaVision, we strive to break barriers and foster inclusivity within the manga community and expanding outward.

## Resources Exploration

### Documentations
[Object Detection for Comics using Manga109 Annotations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08670.pdf) - The article introduces solutions for object detection in comics, notably the Manga109-annotations dataset and the SSD300-fork method. Created over eight months, Manga109-annotations provides comprehensive annotations for bounding boxes, character names, and text contents. SSD300-fork addresses assignment issues by replicating the detection layer for each category, outperforming other CNN-based methods with a 3% mAP improvement and a 9% boost in face detection accuracy over SSD300. Application of SSD300-fork to eBDtheque demonstrates significant advancements in body detection compared to existing methods. Overall, the paper contributes valuable insights and solutions to the challenges of object detection in comics.
